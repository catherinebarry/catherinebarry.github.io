                <p>Students in on-campus housing are not receiving meals that meet their daily dietary restrictions/preferences while in quarantine. The users need a way to communicate their specific dietary needs to the school to allow them to get healthy and appropriate meal options while recovering from COVID-19. Our solution should allow them to customize meals, indicate dietary needs, and choose between meal options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. </p>
